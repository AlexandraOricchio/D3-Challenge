# D3-Challenge

### Background
Welcome to the newsroom! I just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. I am tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.
The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

### Core Assignment 
Using D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with a circle element. When you click on a circle element, a tooltip will display the state, the percentage in poverty and the percentage lacking healthcare. I added additional axis labels with event listeners so users can decide which demographics and risk factors to display on the scatter plot. 

### The Data 
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml.  
The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 
MOE stands for "margin of error."
